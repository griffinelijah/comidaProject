Have you made changes to your role recently? Have you improved your process in any way as a result of #COVID19? What has really been different in the last two weeks? Did you make more decisions? Did you have less time to consult, engage, inform because delivery was the priority?

@my_carol Trump says he's taking a pill every day (which, if true, is 200 mg daily). #Hydroxychloroquine is a weight-based drug. (I weigh 120 lbs and take a maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily for Sjogren's and arthritis). For a man the size of Trump, this is a placebo dose. #COVID19
