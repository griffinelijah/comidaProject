@PlutoEllis @Hybridcell1977 @Ianblackford_MP The Highlands is a remote area. We have healthcare geared up to the needs of the current population.

@TomiLahren You're kidding right? He would never stop incentives for illegals. They're his 2nd largest voting block after the deceased. Maybe that's why the mishandling of #COVID19 in congregate living facilities. The elderly are most at risk, so kill them off, implement mail-in voting... 🤔
